IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS:

To install Nest you need a bit more steps.
You first need to install a virtual box, click on "windows host" in the following link:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Once you intsalled the virtualbox and followed the installation steps you can install Nest.
During the setup of the virtual box I suggest you to set the Virtual box to "linux" system.   
You can then download Nest Live medium here: 
https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/livemedia.html
and follow the steps in "NEST image setup" in the link. 

Then go inside the virtual box and install Anaconda.
