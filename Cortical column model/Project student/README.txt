Here a new version of the cortical column code is provided. 
This code reproduce the results of the cortical column with fixed weights (no STDP rule). 
This code (created by Rares Dorcioman) is a better version of 'MAIN_CODE1_fixed_weights.py'

There are 3 .py codes, to run the model you only need to run "simulate.py". 
You don't need any additional file.
