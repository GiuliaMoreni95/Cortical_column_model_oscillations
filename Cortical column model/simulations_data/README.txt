Here there are all the simulations data produced by the model of the cortical column. 

The data are organized in folders,
to be able to use the jupyter notebook to generate figures the gerarchical order of the folder MUST stay intact. 

Here I provide the zip file of the folder. 
Download the entire project 'Cortical column model' and unzip the simulations_data folder.
