The codes in this folder are the codes used to generate all the simulations performed in the paper.

1. Program of the cortical column model with fixed weights. 'MAIN_CODE1_fixed_weights.py'
2. Program of the cortical column model with Synaptic plasticity STDP. 'MAIN_CODE2_STDPrule.py'
3. Program that uploads the state of the network after synaptic plasticity 
and continues a simulation with those fixed weights. 'MAIN_CODE3_RestoredNetwork.py'

With Program n.1 the results presented in Fig. 2,3 can be obtained.
With Program n.2 the connections of excitatory neurons are plastic. With this we can obtain all the results presented in Fig.4
With Program n.3 all the optogenetic experiments presented in the paper can be performed. (results of Fig. 5,6,7)

To run the MAIN CODES Brain2 should be installed. 
See https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html for installations.
Once you have Brian (and python) installed in your machine (and you have downloaded this porject folder)
type in your terminal: 'python MAIN_CODE_name.py' to run the desired simualtion.
