Welcome!

This project folder contains everything you need to reproduce the results presented in the paper:
'Cell type specific firing patterns in a V1 cortical column model depend on feedforward and feedback activity' Moreni et Al. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.02.587673v1.full
The paper is also provided here in pdf 'Paper2_Moreni_etAl.pdf'

REPRODUCIBILITY OF FIGURES:
All the jupyter notebooks presented here (in the folder 'scripts_figures') will generate the figures of the paper.
The title of each jupyter netebook corresponds to the desired figure. Running them will show and save the desired figure. 
To run the jupyter notebooks codes you only need: 
- python >=3.0
- jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/
- matplotlib>=3.4.3
- seaborn>=0.11.2

FOLDERS ORGANISATION:
The folder 'scripts_figures' contain the jupyter notebooks to reproduce all the figures. 
The folder 'IMAGES' will contain the figures generated by the jupyter notebooks.

The folder 'simulations_data' contains all the data that you need in order to generate the figures. 
These data were obtained by running simulations using the main code.  
The folder 'scripts_simulations' contain the main code used to generate all the results of the simulations. 

The folder 'import_files' contains files that the main code needs to perform the simulations.
The folder 'general_files' contains files that the main code produces to save some relevant info.

IMPORTANT:
Keep the structure of the folder intact to be able to run the jupyter notebooks and generate all the desired figures. The same is true for the main simulations.
Download the entire folder and then just run the jupyter notebooks/main codes in your machine. 

MAIN CODE:
All the data in 'simulations_data' were generated with the code MAIN_CODE_iterate.py contained in 'scripts_simulations'.

To run the MAIN CODE Brain2 should be installed. 
See https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html for installations.
Once you have Brian (and python) installed in your machine (and you have downloaded this porject folder) to run the desired simulation just type in your terminal: 
'python MAIN_CODE_iterate.py' 

In order to run the script multiple times with a perturbative input each time going to a different cell group I used the script script_iterations_perturbation.sh
(This was useful for the perturbation analysis). 
#To run this just type in your terminal:
chmod +x script_iterations_perturbation.sh
And then: 
./script_iterations_perturbation.sh


FINAL REMARKS:
If you run into any problem while reproducing the results you can always contact me at 
g.moreni@uva.nl and I will be happy to help you!

Best,

Giulia Moreni
