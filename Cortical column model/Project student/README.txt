Here a new version of the cortical column code is provided. 
Rares Dorcioman created a new verson with better coding style than the standard version. 
There are 3 .py codes, to run the model you only need to run "simulate.py".

This code only reproduce the results of the cortical column with fixed weights (no STDP rule).
