Welcome!

This project folder contains everything you need to reproduce the results presented in the paper:
'Synaptic plasticity is required for oscillations in a V1 cortical column model with multiple interneuron types' Moreni et Al. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.27.555009v1
The paper is also provided here in pdf 'Paper_Moreni_etAl.pdf'

REPRODUCIBILITY OF FIGURES:
All the jupyter notebooks presented here (in the folder 'scripts_figures') will generate the figures of the paper.
The title of each jupyter netebook corresponds to the desired figure. Running them will show and save the desired figure. 
To run the jupyter notebooks codes you only need: 
- python >=3.0
- jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/
- matplotlib>=3.4.3
- seaborn>=0.11.2

FOLDERS ORGANISATION:
The folder 'scripts_figures' contain the jupyter notebooks to reproduce all the figures. 
The folder 'IMAGES' will contain the figures generated by the jupyter notebooks.

The folder 'simulations_data' contains all the data that you need in order to generate the figures. 
These data were obtained by running simulations using the main 3 codes (see below).  
The folder 'scripts_simulations' contain the 3 main codes used to generate all the results of the simulations. 

The folder 'import_files' contains files that the main code needs to perform the simulations.
The folder 'general_files' contains files that the main code produces to save some relevant info.

IMPORTANT:
Keep the structure of the folder intact to be able to run the jupyter notebooks and generate all the desired figures. The same is true for the main simulations.
Download the entire folder and then just run the jupyter notebooks/main codes in your machine. 

MAIN CODES:
All the data in 'simulations_data' were generated with these 3 main codes .py contained in 'scripts_simulations'.
1. Program of the cortical column model with fixed weights. 'MAIN_CODE1_fixed_weights.py'
2. Program of the cortical column model with Synaptic plasticity STDP. 'MAIN_CODE2_STDPrule.py'
3. Program that uploads the state of the network after synaptic plasticity 
and continues a simulation with those fixed weights. 'MAIN_CODE3_RestoredNetwork.py'

With Program n.1 the results presented in Fig. 2,3 can be obtained.
With Program n.2 the connections of excitatory neurons are plastic. With this we can obtain all the results presented in Fig.4
With Program n.3 all the optogenetic experiments presented in the paper can be performed. (results of Fig. 5,6,7)

To run the MAIN CODES Brain2 should be installed. 
See https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html for installations.
Once you have Brian (and python) installed in your machine (and you have downloaded this porject folder)
type in your terminal: 'python MAIN_CODE_name.py' to run the desired simulation.

PROJECT STUDENT folder:
In this folder a nicer version of the main code is presented. You might want to use and read this version.  
This was implemented with by Rares Dorcioman as part of his internship. 

FINAL REMARKS:
If you run into any problem while reproducing the results you can always contact me at 
g.moreni@uva.nl and I will be happy to help you!

Best,

Giulia Moreni
